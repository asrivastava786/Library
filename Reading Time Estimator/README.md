# Read Time Estimator
## Would you like to engage more people in your blog?

As explained in NY:
```
  In 2011, the psychologists Claude Messner and Michaela Wänke investigated what, 
  They concluded that … the faster we decide on something, whether it’s what we’re going to eat or what we’re going to read, 
  the happier we become.
  The more we know about something — including precisely how much time it will consume — the greater the chance we will commit to it.

```
